# The Soranus Class

This is an experimental class that is _somewhat_ functional but _not_ production ready. It is intended for general use, _i.e._ technical reports, journal articles, books of all kinds, _&c._ My hope is that even people outside the natural sciences and mathematics will find this class valuable and pleasant to use.

Named after [the Roman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quintus_Valerius_Soranus "Quintus Valerius Soranus") who is credited with inventing the table of contents.
